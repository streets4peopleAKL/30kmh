# How to make a 30 km/h sign

I made this sign to try and slow car drivers in my neighbourhood. 

## Inspiration

During the lockdown cars disappeared from our local streets and the people came back - slowly at first, as if they couldn't quite believe it was now safe to cycle or let their kids play on the footpath. By the end of the lockdonw the sreets were alive with people walking with their familes, parents on bikes with their kids, seniors taking a stroll. 

I want to try and keep that vibe.

Inspired by Hone Harawira's practical approach to public health management and law enforcement  (https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/121036470/coronavirus-police-order-hone-harawiras-covid19-checkpoints-to-run-correctly I thought a 30-km/h sign might help to kepp traffic speeds down post lockdown.

## Tools and Materials
To make the sign you will need:
* Sturdy cardboard, corflute or thin plywood 600mm x 600mm
* 6 sheets of A4 paper
* An inkjet or colour laser printer
* String
* Nail
* Pencil
* Straight edge
* Craft knife
* Scissors
* PVA Glue 
* Clear packaging tape
* 6 x 25 cm cable ties

## The Process
Making the sign is a realtively simple seven-step process:

1. Make the backing
2. Download the graphic
3. Print the graphic on 6 sheets of A4 paper
4. Trim the paper edges
5. Glue the paper to the backing
6. Waterproof the sign
7. Put the sign up 

### 1. Make the backing
You need a solid but lightweight backing material that will fit a 600 mm diameter circle. I used cardboard but if you can get it recycled coreflute would be best.

Tie a piece of string to a pencil and a nail. Make the distance between the mail and the pencil 300 mm. Push the nail through the backing material, pull the string taught and draw a circle. Cut the circle out.

### 2. Download the graphic
Down the graphic 30kmh.png from here 

### 3. Print the graphic
I used Microsoft Paint to do this following the instructions from here: https://www.digitalcitizen.life/print-large-image-multiple-pages-4-steps-using-microsoft-paint. I'm sure you can do this on a Mac somehow - perhaps Adobe Reader can do it https://macintoshhowto.com/printing/how-to-print-across-multiple-pages-or-make-a-banner-in-osx.html

Select portrait mode, 3 pages across and 2 down. Set the margins as narrow as the printer can manage.  

I used regular paper and a cheap inkjet printer. Better paper and a laser printer would help if you have access to it.

### 4. Trim the paper edges
Trim off the margins. I used a craft knife and a steel ruler but scissors would work. You want to get a really straight edge so the numbers join up nicley when you put them back together.

Cut around the edge of the red circle.

### 5. Glue the paper to the backing
Draw a pencil line across the centre of the circle through the hole left by the nail when you drew the circle. Lay your sheets out on the circle to make sure they fit.

Apply glue to the back of the sheet that is going to go on the bottom half in the middle. I used a glue stick but PVA would be better. Align the top of the sheet to the pencil line across the cicrle making sure the sheet has equal space down each side. Smooth it out downwards squeezing out any air bubbles.

Repeat for the top, middle sheet aligning the bottom of the sheet to the pencil line and making sure the numbers join nicely.

Repeat for the corner sheets making sure the numbers align and the red circle edges join nicely.

I had some trouble getting the glue to stick so added some more o the edges and ironed with a dry iron and brown paper between the iron and the sign.

### 6. Waterproof the sign
I did this by applying clear packaging tape in overlapping strips to the whole sign including the front and the back. It's kind of wasteful but you can buy tape cheaply from a $2 shop when they reopen.

### 7. Put the sign up
You might want to do this last step when it's dark.

Scout a power pole or street sign you can attach the sign to. It should be near the entrance to your street or neighbourhood in a place where drivers can see it. You should mount it as high as you can without needing a ladder to make it harder to pull down. Look for something you can strap the sign to using cable ties.

Join as many cable ties as you will need to secure the sign. Drill two holes in your sign near the middle. Thread the cable ties through one hole in the sign, around the sign pole or a piece of conduit on a power pole and back through the other hole. Connect the cable tie at the front, pull it tight and snip off the ends. .
